        <p><b>Automation Testing Services</b><br />
At STACKDOCX SOLUTIONS PVT LMT, we provide expert Automation Testing solutions to ensure your software is efficient, reliable, and ready to scale. By automating repetitive and complex testing tasks, we help you accelerate your development process, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall quality of your applications. Our team leverages the latest automation tools and frameworks to deliver precise, rapid, and scalable testing solutions.</p>

<p><b>Our Automation Testing Offerings:</b></p>

<p><b>1. End-to-End Test Automation</b><br />
We develop comprehensive, automated test suites that cover every aspect of your application, from front-end functionality to back-end processes. This ensures that your entire system is thoroughly tested for bugs, performance issues, and compatibility across all platforms.</p>

<p><b>2. Regression Testing Automation</b><br />
Automation plays a critical role in regression testing, allowing you to verify that new updates or features do not negatively impact existing functionality. We automate regression tests to streamline updates and ensure that your software remains stable after changes, saving time and improving accuracy.</p>

<p><b>3. Performance Test Automation</b><br />
Our performance testing automation ensures that your application performs optimally under various load conditions. We simulate real-world traffic and stress scenarios using automated tools, identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring your app can handle peak loads efficiently.</p>

<p><b>4. Cross-Browser & Cross-Platform Testing</b><br />
With automated cross-browser and cross-platform testing, we ensure that your application delivers a consistent user experience across all devices and browsers. By automating these tests, we reduce the time and effort required to verify compatibility across multiple environments.</p>

<p><b>5. API Automation Testing</b><br />
We automate API testing to validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of your application's back-end services. This ensures smooth communication between different components of your software and third-party integrations, while reducing the time needed for manual testing.</p>

<p><b>6. Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Integration</b><br />
We integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that every code change is automatically tested before deployment. This enables faster release cycles, better code quality, and reduced risk of post-deployment issues. Our expertise includes tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.</p>

<p><b>7. Mobile App Automation Testing</b><br />
For mobile apps, we provide automated testing across iOS and Android platforms using tools like Appium and XCTest. Our mobile automation testing services cover a wide range of scenarios, including performance, usability, and functionality across various devices and OS versions.</p>

<p><b>8. Test Script Development & Maintenance</b><br />
We develop, execute, and maintain reusable automated test scripts tailored to your application’s needs. Our test scripts are designed to be scalable and adaptable, ensuring they remain effective as your application evolves.</p>
