          <div className="mt-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 space-y-8">
            <p><b>Customer service:</b> Automated customer service can help manage more inquiries and free up human agents to focus on more complex requests. For example, automation can be used to schedule rides, send invoices, or distribute onboarding materials.</p>
            <p><b>Communication:</b> Automated communication can be triggered by actions like a subscriber's birthday, an abandoned online cart, or a long period of time without opening an email. Automation can be implemented using AI, chatbots, or process automation platforms.</p>
            <p><b>Data capture:</b> Automated data capture can help accountancy firms manage documents like tax returns, receipts, and income statements. It can also help speed up document approval workflows.</p>
            <p><b>Web form filling:</b> Automated form filling can be achieved using web extensions like Katalon Recorder. This extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.</p>
            <p><b>Email automation:</b> Automation rules can be used to automatically insert customer information into emails. For example, a rule can be set to automatically insert a customer's name, order number, and delivery track number when an order moves to the "Delivery" stage.</p>
